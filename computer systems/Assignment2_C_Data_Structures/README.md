The queue is a 'first-in, first-out' (FIFO) data structure. Thus queues have a strict policy about how information is stored and accessed. This project will implement a specific implementation of a queue using an array in the [myqueue.h](./myqueue.h) file. This data structure is also called a circular queue (specifically a ring buffer when the maximum storage size is fixed).

# Unit Tests

Unit tests are provided for both the stack and queue to test their functionalities.
