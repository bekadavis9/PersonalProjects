# Computer Systems

The projects in this folder were all completed for CS 3650 (Computer Systems) in Fall 2019. All of the assignments were designed by my professor, Mike Shah, but completed by myself. I have changed the READMEs for clarity and length. 

Note: all programs were designed for and run on the College of Computer Science servers at Northeastern University and may not have the same functionalities on different Linux distributions.
