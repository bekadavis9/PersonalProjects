- This asssignment took me about 10 hours to complete. I spent a good amount of time trying to work with a file that couldn't really be interpreted bybash and ended up having to switch my project completely. I also had a lot of issues with grep. 

- I have not collaborated with any other people on this assignment. 

- Most of my sources are currently in /monorepo-bekadavis9/Assignment1_ShellScript/part1/sources as well as copied below. They are simply cited as URLs. I also used a few stackoverflow suggestions which I forgot to cite, mainly to help me power through some errors.
