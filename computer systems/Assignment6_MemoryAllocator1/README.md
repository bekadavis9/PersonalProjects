**TODO/EDITME** Check only one box for which allocation strategy you implemented (This helps the TAs with grading, we'll figure it out if you forget.)

- [x] First-Fit
- [] Best-Fit allocator

Other notes: *If you did anything above and beyond, or want to leave a TA a note you may do so here.*

# TODO Please edit the following information in your assignment

- Name: Rebekag Davis

- This assignment took me at least 30 hours to complete. I spent the last 20 hours or so trying to get rid of segfaults. I practically rewrote my entire implementation and tweaked everything I could think of and still had no luck. 

  - Edit: I was able to fix the segfaults and my code seems to be running properly. 

- Professor Shah helped me with a few things in the beginning of this assignment.

- Did you use any external resources? (Cite them below)
  - Lab6 Powerpoint from class website
  - https://cs61.seas.harvard.edu/wiki/images/f/fb/Lec10-Dynamic_memory_1.pdf (essentially the same PPT)
  - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13706809/structs-in-c-with-initial-values

- I enjoyed working on this assigment in the beginning but eventually got so frustrated with all of the segfaults I was getting that I found it to be more of a nuisance than an enjoyment. 

# Logistics

For this assignment (and every assignment/lab), you must login into the servers through `your_khoury_name@login.khoury.neu.edu` to complete and test your work. The reason is the examples I will provide below are compiled strictly for our machines architecture, and this is a consistent architecture where your submission will be graded.
